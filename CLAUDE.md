# First Principles Engine

## Build & Test Commands

- `npm run build` — TypeScript check + Vite build (`tsc -b && vite build`)
- `npm run dev` — Start dev server
- `npm test` — Run vitest
- `npm run lint` — Run ESLint
- `npx tsc -b` — Type-check only (no emit)

## TypeScript Constraints

### `erasableSyntaxOnly` is enabled

Do **not** use `enum` declarations — they emit runtime code and are blocked by `erasableSyntaxOnly` in `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`.

Instead, use `as const` objects with companion type aliases:

```ts
export const MyEnum = {
  Foo: 'Foo',
  Bar: 'Bar',
} as const
export type MyEnum = (typeof MyEnum)[keyof typeof MyEnum]
```

### `verbatimModuleSyntax` is enabled

Use `import type` for type-only imports:

```ts
import type { SomeType } from './types'
```

## Deploy

### CI/CD (preferred method)
- **Push to `main`**: CI runs tests. If `firestore.indexes.json` changed, indexes auto-deploy.
- **Push to `deploy` branch**: Full deploy — hosting, functions (if changed), Firestore rules + indexes, Storage rules + CORS.

### How indexes deploy
Firestore indexes deploy automatically in three ways:
1. When `firestore.indexes.json` changes on `main` (`.github/workflows/deploy-indexes.yml`)
2. When functions change on `deploy` branch (deployed alongside functions)
3. Unconditionally on every `deploy` branch push (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` line 74)

You should never need to manually run `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`.

### Manual deploy (use sparingly, from Claude Code)
If you must deploy manually, always include indexes:
```
firebase deploy --only functions,firestore:indexes
```
Never deploy functions without indexes — new queries may require new composite indexes.

## Common Patterns

### Firestore document mapping

When spreading Firestore document data that includes an `id` field, always put `id` **after** the spread so the document ID takes precedence:

```ts
// Correct — document ID wins
const items = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => ({
  ...(doc.data() as MyType),
  id: doc.id,
}))
```

### Vitest config

`vite.config.ts` uses `defineConfig` from `vitest/config` (not `vite`) so the `test` property is typed correctly.

## North Star

**First Principles Engine** is a phone-fast family learning notebook that:
- expresses our Charter/Ethos
- runs daily school (Normal Day / Minimum Viable Day)
- captures evidence artifacts (notes/photos/audio)
- visualizes weekly progress (Flywheel)
- tracks growth (Ladders + Milestones)
- exports records (MO-friendly: logs + hours + portfolio + eval)
- adapts weekly via AI-powered evaluation loop

## First Principles Alignment

The app's growth tracking follows the Ad Astra / Astra Nova pedagogy:
- **Disposition over content mastery**: curiosity, persistence, articulation, self-awareness, ownership
- **Wonder→Build→Explain→Reflect→Share** is the philosophical framework, not a counting system
- **AI synthesizes** growth narratives from data Shelly already captures
- **Conundrums** build ethical reasoning through weekly open-ended scenarios
- **Teach-back** (Lincoln teaches London) is the richest learning evidence
- **No grades, no shame**: "growing" not "passing", struggles are data not failure

## Project Principles

1. **Frictionless daily use**: "Today" must be usable in under 60 seconds.
2. **Small artifacts > perfect documentation**: capture evidence quickly.
3. **Narration counts**: audio evidence is first-class (especially for Lincoln).
4. **Tags power everything**: engineStage + subjectBucket + location + ladderRef.
5. **Defaults everywhere**: reduce decision fatigue.
6. **No heroics**: ship thin slices; keep UI simple; iterate.
7. **Charter alignment**: all AI-generated content must be reviewable against family values.
8. **AI is additive**: local logic stays as fallback; LLM paths are feature-flagged.

## Repo Conventions

### Dates
Store dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings for easy Firestore queries and sorting.

### Tags (required for artifacts)
- `childId`, `engineStage`, `subjectBucket`, `location`, `domain`
- Optional: `ladderRef`, `weekId`, `dayId`, `pillar`

### Mobile-first UI
- Large tap targets, minimal text entry
- Prefer dropdowns + templates
- Keep forms short

### Plan type terminology
Use `'normal'` / `'mvd'` (not the legacy `'A'` / `'B'`) for `DailyPlan.planType`. The `PlanType` const enum in `enums.ts` is the source of truth. Display labels come from `PlanTypeLabel` ("Normal Day" / "Minimum Viable Day"). The Firestore converter in `firestore.ts` normalizes legacy `'A'`→`'normal'` and `'B'`→`'mvd'` on read.

### Commit style
Use clear prefixes: `chore:`, `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`

Aim for commits that implement one component/flow, can be reverted cleanly, and do not mix scope areas.

### Cross-platform npm scripts
Nathan develops on Windows PowerShell. Never use bash-style inline env vars (`FOO=bar cmd`) in npm scripts — they break on Windows. Always use `cross-env`:
```json
"my-script": "cross-env FOO=bar tsx scripts/my-script.ts"
```
See `docs/SCRIPT_CONVENTIONS.md` for full conventions.

|---|---|
| `chapterBooks` | Chapter book library (global, shared across families) |

**Subcollections:**
- `shellyChatThreads/{threadId}/messages` — Messages within a Shelly chat thread
- `children/{childId}/wordProgress` — Knowledge Mine word progress (referenced in `tasks/quest.ts` via raw Firestore path; no collection helper in `firestore.ts`)

**Settings documents:** `settings/plannerDefaults_{childId}` — Per-child planner subject time defaults (used by `tasks/plan.ts`)

## AI Integration

### Architecture
- **Client-side:** `src/core/ai/` contains the service interface and prompt assembly
- **Server-side:** `functions/src/ai/` contains Firebase Cloud Functions that call AI APIs
- **No API keys in client code.** All AI calls route through Cloud Functions.

### Providers
- **Claude (Anthropic):** Primary provider for reasoning, planning, evaluation, content generation
- **OpenAI:** Image generation (DALL-E) for visual materials

### AI Rules of Engagement
1. **Feature flags for AI paths.** Local logic in planner-chat stays as fallback. AI paths are opt-in via config.
2. **System prompts are version-controlled** in `src/core/ai/prompts/`. Every prompt is reviewable.
3. **Charter values are injected** into every system prompt. See `docs/SYSTEM_PROMPTS.md`.
4. **Child context is assembled per-request** from Firestore (skill snapshot, pace data, recent sessions).
5. **Cost tracking:** Log token usage and model used to Firestore for monitoring.
6. **Model selection by task:**
   - Complex reasoning (plan, evaluate, quest, generateStory, workshop, analyzeWorkbook, disposition, conundrum, weeklyFocus, scan, shellyChat): Claude Sonnet (`claude-sonnet-4-6`)
   - Routine generation (generate, chat): Claude Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)
   - Image generation: DALL-E 3 (scenes, armor sheets) + gpt-image-1 (transparent stickers, photo transform)

### Testing AI Logic
- Co-locate tests with logic files (e.g., `skipAdvisor.logic.test.ts`, `pace.logic.test.ts`)
- Mock AI API responses in tests — never call real APIs in test suite
- Test prompt assembly separately from API calls
- Snapshot test system prompts to catch unintended changes

### Prompt Files
- `src/core/ai/prompts/plannerPrompts.ts` — Weekly plan generation (client-side)
- `functions/src/ai/tasks/` — All other prompt assembly lives in Cloud Function task handlers (plan, evaluate, quest, workshop, generateStory, analyzeWorkbook, disposition, conundrum, weeklyFocus, scan, shellyChat, chat, analyzePatterns, chapterQuestions)

### Cloud Functions (19 exported)
- `chat` — Task dispatch (plan, evaluate, quest, workshop, generateStory, analyzeWorkbook, disposition, conundrum, weeklyFocus, scan, shellyChat, chat, generate, chapterQuestions)
- `analyzeEvaluationPatterns` — Pattern analysis from evaluation sessions
- `weeklyReview` — Scheduled weekly review (Sunday 7pm CT)
- `generateWeeklyReviewNow` — Manual review trigger
- `generateActivity` — Lesson card generation
- `healthCheck` — Diagnostic endpoint
- 12 image functions: `generateImage`, `generateAvatarPiece`, `generateStarterAvatar`, `transformAvatarPhoto`, `generateArmorPiece`, `generateBaseCharacter`, `generateArmorSheet`, `generateArmorReference`, `extractFeatures`, `generateMinecraftSkin`, `generateMinecraftFace`, `enhanceSketch`

### Cloud Functions Structure
- `functions/src/index.ts` — Main entry point, exports all Cloud Functions
- `functions/src/ai/chat.ts` — Main chat CF, task type routing, prompt builders
- `functions/src/ai/chatTypes.ts` — callClaude helper, task handler types
- `functions/src/ai/contextSlices.ts` — Per-task context loading (charter, child, engagement, etc.)
- `functions/src/ai/aiConfig.ts` — AI configuration (model selection, tokens, etc.)
- `functions/src/ai/aiService.ts` — Core AI service orchestration
- `functions/src/ai/sanitizeJson.ts` — JSON response sanitization
- `functions/src/ai/health.ts` — Health check endpoint
- `functions/src/ai/tasks/` — Task handlers: plan, evaluate, quest, workshop, generateStory, analyzeWorkbook, disposition, conundrum, weeklyFocus, scan, shellyChat, chat, analyzePatterns, chapterQuestions
- `functions/src/ai/generate.ts` — Activity/lesson card generation
- `functions/src/ai/evaluate.ts` — Weekly review (scheduled + manual)
- `functions/src/ai/imageGen.ts` — Image generation routing
- `functions/src/ai/imageTasks/` — 13 image task handlers (armorPiece, armorReference, armorSheet, avatarPiece, baseCharacter, enhanceSketch, extractFeatures, generateImage, minecraftFace, minecraftSkin, photoTransform, starterAvatar, + index)
- `functions/src/ai/providers/` — Claude + OpenAI provider adapters (with `__stubs__/` for test mocking)

## Family Context (for AI prompt reference)

### Children
- **Lincoln (10):** Speech + neurodivergence. ~3rd grade math, ~1st grade reading. Phonics recently clicking. Motivators: Minecraft, Lego, Art. Needs short routines, frequent wins, visual checklists, low-friction starters.
- **London (6):** Kindergarten. Story-driven, creates own books. Knows most letter sounds. Motivators: Stories, drawing, book-making. Needs attention-rich interactive activities; disengages when unsupervised.

### Energy Modes (PlanType: `'normal'` | `'mvd'`)
- **Normal Day (`PlanType.Normal`):** Full routine (formation + reading stations + math stations + together block)
- **Minimum Viable Day (`PlanType.Mvd`):** Prayer/Scripture + read aloud + math practice + project/life-skills + one-sentence reflection. This is the floor. Both modes count as real school.

### Scheduling Constraint
Shelly's direct attention is the primary schedulable resource. Kids need split-block scheduling: Lincoln gets direct support while London does independent work, then swap. Running simultaneously means London's volume wins and Lincoln loses support.

## Known Technical Debt

- **PlannerChatPage.tsx (2,252L)** — Decomposed render (800→500L) but state management is still ~1,700L. Interconnected wizard/chat/plan/apply state makes further splitting complex. Stable as-is.
- **BookEditorPage.tsx (1,886L)** — Grew from themes + drawing flows. Handlers interleaved but clear section boundaries. Could extract sketch/voice/sticker panels later.
- **ShellyChatPage.tsx (1,653L)** — 23+ useState hooks. Image generation, thread management, follow-up suggestions, image refinement flow. Decomposition candidate after usage patterns stabilize.
- **WorkshopPage.tsx (1,606L)** — Phase-based rendering delegates to sub-components. Handlers share `currentGame` state across 3 game types. Not urgent.
- **chat.ts CF (1,599L)** — Grew +420 from quest expansion. buildQuestPrompt alone is 400+ lines. Consider extracting prompt builders to separate files.
- **useQuestSession.ts (1,544L)** — Grew from 954L. Quest, comprehension, fluency all in one hook. Consider splitting by quest domain.
- **MyAvatarPage.tsx (1,386L)** — Decomposed from 1,862L. Grew +152 from forge + portal. State management + ceremony flow. Stable.
- **VoxelCharacter.tsx (1,242L)** — Three.js render code at `src/features/avatar/VoxelCharacter.tsx`. Splitting the render loop is risky. Leave as-is.
- **Ladder system** — Partially deprecated. Disposition system replacing it. 5 files have TODO comments marking ladder references for removal.
- **evaluate.ts (weekly review)** — Now uses CHARTER_PREAMBLE + addendum, but still separate from the task system. Not in task registry.
- **WorkbookConfig → ActivityConfig migration** — Both systems exist. ActivityConfig is the new primary (66 refs vs 27). workbookConfigs still read by quest starting level check and certificate scan. Plan: complete migration, remove workbookConfig references.
- **Bundle size** — Main chunk is 3.4MB (1MB gzipped). Should code-split Three.js, jsPDF, and heavy features.
- **Hours partial-day edge** — If a day has some blocks with actualMinutes and others without, only tracked blocks count. By design but undocumented.
