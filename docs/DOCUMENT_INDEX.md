## Workflow

```
Claude.ai (design chat)
  ↓ designs features, generates prompts, reviews architecture
  ↓
Claude Code (this repo)
  ↓ builds features, updates repo docs, runs tests
  ↓
Google Drive (BarnesHomeschool/)
  → family/values docs (Charter, Learner Profiles, Shelly Feedback)
  → referenced by system prompts but not stored in repo
```

- **Claude.ai** is the design + strategy layer — Shelly and Nathan discuss features, generate prompt drafts, review priorities
- **Claude Code** is the build layer — implements features, maintains repo docs, runs CI
- **Google Drive** holds family context documents that are referenced by AI system prompts but don't belong in a code repo
