# First Principles Engine — Master Scope
Date: 2026-02-07

This repository is the **family learning notebook** for the “First Principles Engine”:
- Express our **ethos/charter**
- Track progress for **Lincoln + London**
- Visualize the **learning flywheel**
- Maintain **records + exports** (MO-friendly)
- Store artifacts (notes/photos/audio) as **evidence** for milestones + growth

---

## Product North Star
A tool that makes the right thing easy:
- **Daily execution** is frictionless (Plan A / Plan B)
- **Evidence capture** is fast and meaningful
- **Weekly reflection** is built-in
- **Progress** is visible (flywheel + ladders)
- **Records** are exportable on demand

---

## Scopes (Phased)
### Phase 1 — MVP v0.1 (Use daily)
- App shell + nav
- Today: DayLog + blocks + checklists + quick notes
- Artifact capture (Notes only)
- Engine page: flywheel status per child (weekly)
- Records page: hours totals + CSV exports

Doc: `01_MVP_V0_1.md`

### Phase 2 — Engine + Ladders (Progress clarity)
- Ladder definitions + per-child progress tracking
- Link artifacts → ladder rungs
- Engine overlays: “rungs touched this week”
- Better weekly planning + track goals

Doc: `02_ENGINE_LADDERS.md`

### Phase 3 — Records + Compliance Pack
- Hours generation from logs, robust reporting
- “MO Pack” export: hours summary + daily log + eval + portfolio highlights

Doc: `03_RECORDS_COMPLIANCE.md`

### Phase 4 — Media Capture (Photos/Audio) + Storage
- Add photo/audio capture + upload to Firebase Storage
- Artifact gallery improvements + offline-friendly capture patterns

Doc: `04_MEDIA_CAPTURE.md`

### Phase 5 — Deployment + Ops
- Hosting (Firebase Hosting or Vercel)
- Basic auth, environment management, backups
- Operational runbook

Doc: `05_DEPLOYMENT_OPERATIONS.md`

## Shared Design Principles
- **Small artifacts > perfect documentation**
- **Narration counts** (especially for Lincoln)
- **Tags power everything** (engine stage + subject bucket + location + ladder rung)
- **Default templates** reduce decision fatigue
- **Make it “phone-fast”** (big buttons, minimal typing)

---

## Definition of Done (overall)
- A parent can run “Today” in < 60 seconds to start.
- In a tough week, we still capture a minimum flywheel loop (Wonder+Explain+Reflect).
- At any moment, we can export: daily logs + hours + portfolio highlights + eval notes.
