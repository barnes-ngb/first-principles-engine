# Phase 4 — Media Capture (Photo/Audio) + Storage
Date: 2026-02-07

## Objective
Enable the evidence that matters most:
- Photo artifacts (builds, worksheets)
- Audio artifacts (narration/teach-back, speech practice)

## In-Scope Deliverables
- Firebase Storage uploads + URL handling
- Capture flows:
  - Capture Photo → upload → create artifact
  - Record Audio → upload → create artifact
- Gallery + artifact detail view improvements

## Acceptance Criteria
- Audio can be recorded and appears in Engine counts the same week.
- Photo uploads are reliable with retries.
