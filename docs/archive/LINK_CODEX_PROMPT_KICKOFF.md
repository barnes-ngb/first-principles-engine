You are Codex working in the First Principles Engine repo.

### Goals
Implement the requested feature **with minimal, mobile-first UI friction**, respecting the Lincoln “noise-cut” spec.

### Constraints (must follow)
- Do not use copyrighted art/assets (Minecraft/Mario).
- Keep changes small and file-scoped; avoid refactors unless asked.
- Maintain existing patterns (MUI, Vite, Firebase).
- All Firestore calls must be wrapped with try/catch and show snackbars on errors.
- Update or add unit tests for pure logic you touch.

### Context
Read these files first (if present):
- AGENTS.md (or AGENT.md if that’s what the repo uses)
- docs/agent/00_MASTER_SCOPE.md and the current phase doc
- src/core/types/* and src/core/firebase/*

### Deliverable format
1) List files you will change/create
2) Implement changes
3) Provide a short manual test checklist

Now do the following task:
