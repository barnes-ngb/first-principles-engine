# Phase 2 — Engine + Ladders (Progress Clarity)
Date: 2026-02-07

## Objective
Make progress visible and motivating:
- “What are we growing?”
- “What rung are we on?”
- “What evidence supports it?”

## In-Scope Deliverables
- Ladder definitions (Lincoln + London) stored in Firestore
- MilestoneProgress per child (locked/active/achieved) with evidence links
- UI to link artifacts → ladder rungs
- Engine overlay: rungs touched + newly achieved + suggestions
- This Week page becomes real: theme/virtue/scripture + per-child goals + flywheel plan

## Acceptance Criteria
- Ladders render per child.
- A rung can’t be marked achieved without at least one linked artifact.
- Engine shows rungs touched in the current week.
