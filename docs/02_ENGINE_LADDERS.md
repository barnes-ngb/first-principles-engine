# Phase 2 — Engine + Ladders (Progress Clarity) ✅
Date: 2026-02-07

## Objective
Make progress visible and motivating:
- "What are we growing?"
- "What rung are we on?"
- "What evidence supports it?"

## In-Scope Deliverables
- [x] Ladder definitions (Lincoln + London) stored in Firestore
- [x] MilestoneProgress per child (locked/active/achieved) with evidence links
- [x] UI to link artifacts → ladder rungs (inline on creation + post-hoc in artifact list)
- [x] Engine overlay: rungs touched + newly achieved + suggestions
- [x] This Week page: theme/virtue/scripture/heartQuestion + per-child goals + build lab (materials/steps)
- [x] Lab Mode quick capture page with stage buttons

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Ladders render per child (grouped by domain).
- [x] A rung can't be marked achieved without at least one linked artifact.
- [x] Engine shows rungs touched in the current week.
