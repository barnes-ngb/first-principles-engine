## Doc Accuracy

### Stats Comparison (MASTER_OUTLINE vs Computed)

| Claim | Doc value (before fix) | Computed | Status |
|-------|------------------------|----------|--------|
| TypeScript lines | 178,993 | 179,214 | ⚠️ DRIFT +221 — **AUTO-FIXED** |
| Commits | 125 | 119 | ⚠️ CORRECTION (prior count included branch commits) — **AUTO-FIXED** |
| Test files | 177 | 178 | ⚠️ DRIFT +1 — **AUTO-FIXED** |
| Firestore collections | 37 | 37 | ✅ OK |
| Cloud Functions | 25 | 25 | ✅ OK |
| Chat task types | 19 | 19 | ✅ OK |
| Routes | 34 | 34 | ✅ OK |

> **Note on CF count method:** The multi-line export block for `generateMonthlyReview / generateMonthlyReviewNow / publishMonthlyReview / unpublishMonthlyReview / auditMonthlyReviewSources` in `functions/src/index.ts` requires parsing the full export block, not just single-line grep. Verified at 25 by Python parser.

### Missing File References

| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| `PARENT_EXPERIENCE_AUDIT.md` | Expected carry-over — marked REMOVED in DOCUMENT_INDEX |
| `PARENT_EXPERIENCE_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` | Expected carry-over — marked REMOVED in DOCUMENT_INDEX |
| `QuickCaptureSection.tsx` | Expected carry-over — removed in UX P2.06 |
| `QuickCaptureSection.test.tsx` | Expected carry-over — removed with parent component |
| `CreativeTimeLog.tsx` | Expected carry-over — removed in UX P2.06 |

No new missing file references.

### Nav Accuracy

Code nav (`AppShell.tsx`) matches MASTER_OUTLINE exactly:
- **Parent:** Today, Plan My Week, Weekly Review, Progress, Records, Books, Ask AI, Game Workshop, Dad Lab, Settings
- **Kid:** Today, Knowledge Mine, My Books, Books About Me, My Hero, My Stuff, Game Workshop, Dad Lab

✅ No discrepancies.

### Unindexed Docs

✅ All docs in `docs/` are indexed in `DOCUMENT_INDEX.md`.

### Stale Docs

All docs marked CURRENT were updated within the last 30 days. ✅ No stale docs flagged.

### Task Type Coverage (SYSTEM_PROMPTS.md)

All 19 task types present in `tasks/index.ts` are documented in `SYSTEM_PROMPTS.md`:

`plan` `chat` `generate` `evaluate` `quest` `generateStory` `reviseStory` `revisePage` `workshop` `analyzeWorkbook` `disposition` `conundrum` `weeklyFocus` `scan` `shellyChat` `chapterQuestions` `bookLookup` `lessonVideo` `monthlyReview`

✅ No gaps.

## Decomposition Candidates

No new files crossed 2,000 lines this cycle.

| File | Lines | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `PlannerChatPage.tsx` | 2,669 | KNOWN — state management ~1,700L, complex interconnected state. Stable. (+42 growth, watch.) |
| `chat.ts` (CF) | 2,548 | KNOWN — `buildQuestPrompt` alone 400+ lines. Highest-leverage target. Stable. |
| `BookEditorPage.tsx` | 2,278 | KNOWN — handlers interleaved but clear section boundaries. Stable. |
| `useQuestSession.ts` | 2,161 | KNOWN — quest/comprehension/fluency/encoding all in one hook. Stable. |

## Issues Found

### Auto-Fixed

- **MASTER_OUTLINE.md stats updated:** Lines 178,993→179,214; Commits 125→119; Test files 177→178
- **npm audit fix applied:** `@grpc/grpc-js` high-severity crash vulnerabilities (GHSA-5375-pq7m-f5r2, GHSA-99f4-grh7-6pcq) resolved by patching `package-lock.json`. Production audit now clean (0 vulnerabilities).

### Needs Human Attention

- **Lint warnings (3, unchanged):** `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings in `EvaluateChatPage.tsx:282`, `useQuestSession.ts:779`, `useQuestSession.ts:2026` — all involve `sessionTimer`. Not auto-fixable without reviewing timer semantics.
- **Bundle size 3,916 kB:** Route-level React.lazy splitting would reduce initial load. Heaviest imports: Three.js (avatar), jsPDF (print), curriculum map data. Architectural decision required.
- **Dev dependencies — 13 vulnerabilities (8 moderate, 5 high):** All are dev-only (not in production bundle). `npm audit fix --force` required for remaining dev deps — involves breaking changes. Low priority.
- **PlannerChatPage.tsx growing:** +42 lines this cycle (2,627→2,669). Still KNOWN/stable but trending upward. Worth watching over next 2–3 audits.

---

## Charter Alignment

All 19 task types verified to reference `buildContextForTask`, `CHARTER_PREAMBLE`, or `charterContext`:

- `chat` and `generate` tasks are handled in `tasks/chatHandler.ts` (not standalone files) — both verified to have charter context via `buildContextForTask`. ✅

✅ No charter gaps.
