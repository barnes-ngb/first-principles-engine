# Phase 1 — MVP v0.1 (Daily Usable) ✅
Date: 2026-02-07

## Objective
Ship a minimal app that can be used **today**:
- Run the day (Plan A/B)
- Capture evidence (notes)
- See weekly flywheel status
- Export logs/hours CSV

## In-Scope Deliverables
### App foundation
- [x] React + TS + Router
- [x] MUI theme
- [x] AppShell + navigation

### Today (DayLog)
- [x] Create/load DayLog by date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- [x] Default blocks: Formation, Reading, Speech, Math, Together, Movement, Project, FieldTrip, Other
- [x] Track: planned minutes, actual minutes, location, subject bucket
- [x] Checklists + quick notes

### Artifacts (Notes only)
- [x] Create Note artifacts (content + tags)
- [x] Link to dayId/weekId
- [x] Tags required: childId, engineStage, subjectBucket, location, domain

### Engine (Flywheel)
- [x] Week range derived from today
- [x] Per child: stage counts + loop status + next-stage suggestion

### Records
- [x] School year range: Jul 1 → Jun 30
- [x] Hours totals: total hours, core hours, core-at-home hours
- [x] CSV exports: daily log export for a date range
- [x] If HoursEntry missing: generate from DayLogs

## Out of Scope (Explicit)
- Photo/audio uploads → Phase 4
- Ladder UI + milestone tracking → Phase 2 (now complete)
- Auth + multi-family accounts → Phase 5
- PDF "MO Pack" bundle (CSV only in v0.1) → Phase 3

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create DayLog on first visit and edit without errors.
- [x] Save artifacts and see them reflected in Engine counts.
- [x] Records totals compute correctly.
- [x] CSV export downloads and opens cleanly.
