# Phase 1 — MVP v0.1 (Daily Usable)
Date: 2026-02-07

## Objective
Ship a minimal app that can be used **today**:
- Run the day (Plan A/B)
- Capture evidence (notes)
- See weekly flywheel status
- Export logs/hours CSV

## In-Scope Deliverables
### App foundation
- React + TS + Router
- MUI theme
- AppShell + navigation

### Today (DayLog)
- Create/load DayLog by date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Default blocks: Formation, Reading, Speech, Math, Together, Movement, Project (optional)
- Track: planned minutes, actual minutes, location (Home/Away), subject bucket, involved kids
- Checklists + quick notes

### Artifacts (Notes only)
- Create Note artifacts (content + tags)
- Link to dayId/weekId
- Tags required:
  - childId
  - engineStage (Wonder/Build/Explain/Reflect/Share)
  - subjectBucket
  - location
  - domain (free text)

### Engine (Flywheel)
- Week range derived from today
- Per child: stage counts + loop status + next-stage suggestion

### Records
- School year range: Jul 1 → Jun 30
- Hours totals:
  - total hours
  - core hours (Reading/LA/Math/Science/SS)
  - core-at-home hours
- CSV exports:
  - Daily log export for a date range
- If HoursEntry missing: generate from DayLogs

## Out of Scope (Explicit)
- Photo/audio uploads
- Ladder UI + milestone tracking
- Auth + multi-family accounts
- PDF “MO Pack” bundle (CSV only in v0.1)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create DayLog on first visit and edit without errors.
- Save artifacts and see them reflected in Engine counts.
- Records totals compute correctly.
- CSV export downloads and opens cleanly.
