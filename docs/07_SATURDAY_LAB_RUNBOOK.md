# Saturday Lab Runbook — Dad’s Lab Session
Date: 2026-02-07

Goal: use **First Principles Engine** during a Saturday build session to capture a complete learning loop with minimal friction.

---

## 0) Pre-lab Setup (10 minutes)
### Seed data (Phase 2 seed button)
- [ ] Create children: Lincoln, London
- [ ] Seed ladders (Lincoln + London)
- [ ] Create current WeekPlan with a Build Lab entry

### Pick the lab theme (simple)
- Theme: ____________________
- Heart Question: ____________________
- Wonder Prompt: ____________________
- Build: ____________________
- Share/Serve: ____________________

---

## 1) Run the Session Using the Flywheel
You only need **5 captures**, one per stage.

### Wonder (1–2 minutes)
Capture:
- a question + prediction

Artifact tags:
- engineStage = Wonder
- domain = Science/Engineering (or free-text)
- subjectBucket = Science (or Other)
- location = Home/Away

### Build (30–120 minutes)
Capture:
- photo or note of what you made + 1 iteration
(MVP can be a Note artifact.)

Tags:
- engineStage = Build

### Explain (2–5 minutes)
Capture:
- 60–120 second narration (or note summary)
If audio capture isn’t implemented yet, record as a note and optionally add an audio file later.

Tags:
- engineStage = Explain

### Reflect (2 minutes)
Capture:
- “worked / hard / next” (3-line retro)

Tags:
- engineStage = Reflect

### Share/Serve (2–10 minutes)
Capture:
- who you shared with + what happened
- or an act of service (“helped dad with…”)

Tags:
- engineStage = Share

---

## 2) End-of-session Check (2 minutes)
- [ ] Open Engine page → confirm at least **Minimum Loop** (Wonder+Explain+Reflect)
- [ ] If possible, capture Share and Build to hit **Full Loop**
- [ ] Link at least one artifact to a ladder rung (Phase 2)
- [ ] Add a short Evaluation note if you want (Phase 3 later)

---

## 3) Quick “Demo Night” Artifact Set (optional)
Pick top 3:
1) Best build photo/note
2) Best explanation (audio/note)
3) Best reflection or share moment

---

## Troubleshooting
- If you’re short on time: do Wonder + Explain + Reflect only.
- If kids are tired: reduce typing — use defaults and quick notes.
- If tagging feels heavy: use templates (Phase 2 improvement).
